          <h3>Food for a family</h3>
          <p>
            Food provides opportunities for families to learn about
            responsibility and chores and about working and sharing time
            together. Clearly food plays a greater role than simply nourishing
            our bodies

            employment and earning potential later in life. They are more likely
            to suffer adverse health outcomes and less.
